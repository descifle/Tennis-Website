											Back in 1955 and 1956 Grace Hobbs always said 'we need to clean up those
											weeds and trash
											piles on those fine old tennis courts', per her daughter Torie.
										</p>
										<p>
											In the May 31, 1956 issue of the Herald Argus it was announced that five
											tennis courts
											would be refinished by the first of June if enough residents showed
											interest. The vestry
											of the church chartered the organization to be known as the St. Timothy's
											Tennis Club.
											To this day we still owe the church a big thank you for their continued
											cooperation
											in allowing us to survive all these years.
										</p>
										<p>
											The Argus, on June 14, 1956, announced that the tennis club would officially
											open the coming Sunday,
											June 17, at 2 p.m. with an exhibition match with 11-year old Mac Pardew and
											15-year old Ted Linzey
											and officiated by Frank Roberts.

										</p>
										<p>
											Stated in the 1959 by-laws: Family Membership $23.00, Adults $18.00 and
											Juniors $12.00.

											Our Junior Tennis Club numbered 92, one of the largest groups in the area.
											Little league
											play, established by Robert Stahl started on July 10, 1956.
										</p>
										<p>
											In 1956 the five clay courts were covered with a new product called Har-Tru
											from
											Hagerstown and in 1984 all five courts were redone entirely, including an
											underground
											sprinkler system.
										</p>
										<p>
											Names of some of the prime movers to start this new tennis club were: Grace
											Hobbs,
											Margaret Chapman, Dan Kirby, and Mrs. Herman Cook.
										</p>
										<p>
											Other notable first time members to name a few: Bendann, Cullen, Schlag,
											Develin,
											Doug Moore, Tansey, Axelby, Price, Rathman, Nolan, Howell, McGill, and many
											more.
